#RIP protocol simulation
This project was done in accordance to my networking class. It was written in C#.
#What does it do?
It is a simulation of the RIP routing protocol.
This simulation allows the user to add and shutdown/delete routers, connect and disconnect them.
All these actions update the routing tables of the routers. These tables can be seen in the console.
#What do I need to run it?
The user only needs to alter the simulation parameters in main.cs. No extra modules required.
Opening the project in an IDE will work just fine.
